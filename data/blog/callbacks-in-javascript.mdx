## <a name="what-is-a-callback-function"></a> What is a callback function?

Simply put, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function
that invokes or "calls back" the callback function.

The name callback is just a convention for functions that are passed as arguments to other function.

```js
function cb() {
    // cb does some work
}

function func(someParams, cb) {
    // func does some work
    cb();
    // func does some more work
}
```

Here, `cb` is a callback function that is passed as an argument to the function func. The higher
order function `func` when executed calls back the callback function.

Now the obvious question that arises is: When is a callback function executed?

<HighlightedNote content="Many if not all of us have the notion of associating callbacks with asynchronousity. Well, it turns out that callbacks are synchronous as well." />

## <a name="synchronous-vs-asynchronous-callbacks"></a> Synchronous v/s Asynchronous Callbacks

Synchronous callback executes **along with the execution** of the higher order function to which
the callback is passed to. Synchronous callbacks are blocking in nature.

For example, callbacks passed to array's native higher order functions like map, forEach, find,
etc. are executed synchronously.

```js
const items = [item1, item2, item3];

function logItem(item) {
    console.log(item);
}

items.forEach(logItem);
// logs item1, item2, item3
```

Here, the callback `logItem` is executed synchronously for each item of `items` array.

Asynchronous callback, in contrary, is non-blocking and is **executed at a later time**, for example,
after triggering of some event, it doesnâ€™t necessarily executes along with the execution of the
function it is being passed to.

Examples of asynchronous callbacks are the callbacks being passed to timer functions like
`setTimeout`, `setInterval`.

```js
setTimeout(function logAfter1Seconds() {
    console.log('after 1 sec');
}, 1000);
// logs "after 1 sec" after 1 second

setInterval(function logEvery1Seconds() {
    console.log('every 1 sec');
}, 1000);
// logs "every 1 sec" after every 1 second
```

DOM event handler functions are also executed asynchronously upon occurence of events that they
are attached to.

```js
const btn = document.querySelector('#btn-id');
btn.addEventListener('click', function handleClick() {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
});
// logs 'Button clicked!' when the button is clicked
```

## <a name="callback-hell"></a> Callback Hell

When we have to perform a series of sequential asynchronous operations/tasks one after the other,
we wrap the tasks/functions inside one another as callback functions.

Let's take an example. Let's say, we need to prepare a meal and serve it. There are several steps
that are involved from getting the ingredients to serving the cooked meal: getting ingredients,
cook the meal, get plates to serve, and then serve the meal. If we were to code out these steps,
it will look something like this:

```js
const prepareMeal = nextStep => {
  getIngredients(function (ingredients) {
    cookMeal(ingredients, function (cookedMeal) {
      getPlate(function (plates) {
        putMealInPlate(plates, cookedMeal, function(meal) {
          nextStep(meal)
        })
      })
    })
  })
}

// Make and serve the meal
prepareMeal(function (meal) => {
  serveMeal(meal)
})
```

Notice the pyramid shaped structure our code is taking on, famously referred to as 'callback hell'
or 'pyramid of doom'. These are just few steps that we performed for preparing and serving a
meal. If it were a complex tasks involving many more steps, the code complexity and readibility
would have gone for a toss!

JavaScript promises, introduced in ES6/ES2015 helped overcome this by linearly chaining the steps
required to perform an operation with multiple asynchronous steps. Async/await, introduced in ES2017
simplified it even more by giving promises a syntactically sugared synchronous looking structure.

## <a name="error-first-callbacks-a-convention"></a> Error First Callbacks: A Convention

Passing error object as the first argument to a callback function is often a reason why people,
specially beginners, scratch their head figuring out why we do this.

```js
someFunc(function (err, someData) {
    if (err) {
        throw err; // or return or do whatever
    }
    // rest of the function
});
```

Passing error object as the first argument is just a convention and is considered a good practice.
