## <a name="what-is-a-promise"></a> What is a promise?

A promise object depicts a "promise" to get the result of an asynchronous operation, essentially
acting as a placeholder for the value that is to be returned by the asynchronous operation.

For example, to get data from a server, we make an HTTP request using the fetch API like this:

```js
// fetch returns a promise
const res = fetch('https://someapi.com/api/some_end_point');
```

Here, `res` acts as a placeholder promise object that gets response data from the API.

## <a name="promise-states"></a> Promise States

A promise can be in one of these 3 states:

-   **pending**: when promise is just being created. Promise remains in pending state as long as
    the asynchronous operation is taking place
-   **fulfilled**: when the asynchronous operation completes successfully
-   **rejected**: when asynchronous operation fails

A promise fulfilled or rejected is **settled**.

Let's build up on top of the example stated above.

```js
// fetch returns a promise
const res = fetch('https://someapi.com/api/some_end_point');
res.then((res) => console.log(res));
res.catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

We can access the fulfilled value of a promise through `.then()` method.
Similarly, we can access the rejected value / error of a rejected promise through `.catch()`
method. Alternatively, we can access the rejected value of a promise in the second argument of
the `.then()` method.

```js
const res = fetch('https://someapi.com/api/some_end_point');
res.then(
    (res) => {
        console.log(res);
    },
    (err) => {
        console.log(err);
    }
);
```

## <a name="promise-chaining"></a> Promise Chaining

We saw that we can `.then()` and `.catch()` a promise to access the fulfilled and rejected values
respectively. It turns out, `.then()` and `.catch()` themselves return a promise, which poses a
great opportunity to perform multiple operations on the promise values.

```js
somePromise
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((res) => console.log(res))
    .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

If any of the promise rejects, then the flow gets to the first `.catch()` block surpassing all
`.then()` blocks.

## <a name="promise-constructor-and-static-methods"></a> Promise() Contructor and Static Methods

We can create our own promise object using `Promise` constructor. The constructor accepts a
callback function with two callbacks as arguments: one for fulfilled and other for rejected
promise.

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (asyncOperationSuccess) {
        resolve(value);
    } else {
        reject(error);
    }
});
```

### Static Methods of Promise Object:

1. **Promise.all()**:

```js
const promises = Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3,...]);
```

-   Accepts an array of promises and returns a promise
-   If all promises of the array get fulfilled, the returned promise from `Promise.all()` gets
    resolved with value equal to the list of fulfilled values of all promises
-   Even if (and as soon as) one promise gets rejected in the array of promises, the returned
    promise from `Promise.all()` gets rejected with the value of the rejected promise

2. **Promise.any()**:

```js
const promises = Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3,...]);
```

-   Accepts an array of promises and returns a promise
-   Even if (and as soon as) one promise gets resolved in the array of promises, the returned
    promise from `Promise.any()` gets resolved with the value of the resolved promise
-   If all promises of the array get rejected, the returned promise from `Promise.any()` gets
    rejected with an aggregate error containing the rejection values of the array of promises

3. **Promise.allSettled()**:

```js
const promises = Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3,...]);
/*
let's assume promise1 and promise2 get fulfilled and promise3 gets rejected
promises: {
    {status: 'fulfilled', value: value1},
    {status: 'fulfilled', value: value2},
    {status: 'rejected', reason: reason3}
}
*/
```

-   Accepts an array of promises and returns a promise
-   Returns an array of objects containing status and value/reason of all settled promises

4. **Promise.race()**:

```js
const promise = Promise.race([promise1, promise2, promise3,...]);
```

-   Accepts an array of promises and returns a promise
-   Returns a promise which gets fulfilled or rejected depending on the promise that settles first.
    If the first promise to settle is fulfilled, the resultant promise gets fulfilled. If the first
    promise to settle gets rejected, the resultant promise gets rejected.
