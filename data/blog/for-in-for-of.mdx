## <a name="why-these-loops-at-the-first-place"></a> Why these loops at the first place?

Having the classic for loop there, why do we even need `for...in` and `for...of` loops?
Given the object based and prototypical nature of JavaScript, we need more than just looping over
data structures like arrays. While it has been a while since the `for...in` loop
was introduced in the JavaScript, `for...of` got introduced in ES6/ES2015.

## <a name="the-core-iteration-vs-enumeration"></a> The Core: Iteration v/s Enumeration

Both `for...in` and `for...of` can seem similar until we see on what fundamentals are they
both based on. As we will see in greater detail, the `for...in` loop enumerates over the
enumerable preperties of an object, whereas the `for...of` loop iterates over the values of an
iterable object. The difference is subtle. Let's see how Google defines it:

Iteration: "the repetition of a process or utterance"

Enumeration: "the action of mentioning a number of things one by one"

Iteration is simply looping over the values in a repetitive fashion treating all loops alike.
Whereas enumeration can be thought of as listing all the items/properties of an object collection.

## <a name="for-in-loop"></a> for...in Loop

`for...in` loop is used to enumerate the properties of an object. It can operate on all the
objects, be it object literal, array or any other object in JavaScript.

Starting simple, let's enumerate over properties of an object:

```js
const capital_cities = {
    india: 'new delhi',
    usa: 'washington dc',
    uk: 'london',
    france: 'paris',
};

for (let country in capital_cities) {
    console.log(country);
}

// logs india usa uk france
```

Notice how `for...in` loop enumerates over keys of the object, and not the values of the keys.
If we were to print the values, we could do something as simple as this:

```js
const capital_cities = {
    india: 'new delhi',
    usa: 'washington dc',
    uk: 'london',
    france: 'paris',
};

for (let country in capital_cities) {
    console.log(country + ': ' + capital_cities[country]);
}

/* logs
india: new delhi
usa: washington dc
uk: london
france: paris
*/
```

`for...in` loop can loop over only those properties whose <a href="http://es5.github.io/#x8.6.1" target="_blank">[[Enumerable]]</a>
attribute is set to true. By default, all the properties of objects defined using object literal
syntax have their [[Enumerable]] attribute as true. We can have a look at the enumerable
property of an object's property by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor" target="_blank">Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()</a>.

```js
const capital_cities = {
    india: 'new delhi',
    usa: 'washington dc',
    uk: 'london',
    france: 'paris',
};

console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(capital_cities, 'india'));

/* logs
{
  value: 'new delhi',
  writable: true,
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: true
}
*/
```

Note that properties of objects explicitly defined through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty" target="_blank">Object.defineProperty()</a>
have enumerable set to false by default.

Speaking of arrays, `for...in` when ran over an array returns a list of indices, which represent
the keys in case of arrays:

```js
const cities = ['New Delhi', 'Washington DC', 'London', 'Paris'];

for (let city in cities) {
    console.log(city);
}

/* logs 0 1 2 3

the cities array in its object form looks like this:
const cities = {
    0: 'New Delhi',
    1: 'Washington DC',
    2: 'London',
    3: 'Paris'
}
*/

// We can get values of these keys like this:
for (let city in cities) {
    console.log(cities[city]);
}

//logs New Delhi, Washington DC, London, Paris
```

Now it might become intuitive to think array in it's object form. Adding a property on cities
array would look something like this:

```js
let cities = ['New Delhi', 'Washington DC', 'London', 'Paris'];

cities.newCity = 'Berlin';

for (let city in cities) {
    console.log(city);
}

/* logs 0 1 2 3 newCity
cities would now look like this:
const cities = {
    0: 'New Delhi',
    1: 'Washington DC',
    2: 'London',
    3: 'Paris',
    newCity: 'Berlin'
}
*/
```

One very important thing to take note of is that `for...in` loop also loops over all the
enumerable properties up the prototype chain. As an example, let's add some properties on the
built-in objects' prototypes:

```js
Object.prototype.method1 = function () {};
Array.prototype.method2 = function () {};

let cities = ['New Delhi', 'Washington DC', 'London', 'Paris'];

for (let cityKeys in cities) {
    console.log(cityKeys);
}

// logs 0 1 2 3 method2 method1
```

<HighlightedNote content="The above example alters the top level prototypes. However, its a bad practice to manipulate the top level prototypes." />

If cities had multiple levels of inheritance along it's prototype chain, all of the
enumerable properties would show up when cities had been looped over. We can check if a property
belongs to the object being looped by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty" target="_blank">Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty():</a>

```js
Object.prototype.method1 = function () {};
Array.prototype.method2 = function () {};

let cities = ['New Delhi', 'Washington DC', 'London', 'Paris'];

for (let cityKey in cities) {
    if (cities.hasOwnProperty(cityKey)) {
        console.log(cityKey);
    }
}

// logs 0 1 2 3
```

Another way through which we can get hold of an object's own properties is through
Object.entries(). It returns an array of key-value pairs, and since an array is iterable, we can
loop through it using the `for...of` loop or the traditional for loop.

```js
Object.prototype.method1 = function () {};

const capital_cities = {
    india: 'new delhi',
    usa: 'washington dc',
    uk: 'london',
    france: 'paris',
};

let arr = Object.entries(capital_cities);
console.log(arr);

/* logs 
[
  [ 'india', 'new delhi' ],
  [ 'usa', 'washington dc' ],
  [ 'uk', 'london' ],
  [ 'france', 'paris' ]
]
*/
```

`for...in` loop also does not loop over shadowed properties. Shadowed properties are those
properties which are overridden by same name properties of the descendant object.

```js
const capital_cities = {
    india: 'new delhi',
    usa: 'washington dc',
    uk: 'london',
    france: 'paris',
};

// setting more_capital_cities' prototype to capital_cities
let more_capital_cities = Object.create(capital_cities);

// new york is not the capital of usa btw, just for example purpose :)
more_capital_cities.usa = 'new york';
more_capital_cities.canada = 'ottawa';

for (let country in more_capital_cities) {
    console.log(country + ': ' + more_capital_cities[country]);
}

/* logs
usa: new york
canada: ottawa
india: new delhi
uk: london
france: paris
*/
```

<HighlightedNote
    content="We previously saw in few of the above examples, we can loop through an array using for...in loop. But
generally speaking, for...in loop is optimized for generic objects, not arrays. Although it is quite
subjective as different engines implementations vary, but generally, this is the case."

## <a name="for-of-loop"></a> for...of Loop

`for...of` loop is used to loop over an iterable object. Array, String, Map, Set, NodeList,
HTMLCollection are examples of iterable objects in JavaScript.

Let's first understand in brief what an iterable object is. An object is iterable if it
defines the @@iterator key on its prototype chain. The @@iterator key is available
through the Symbol.iterator property that lies on the prototype of iterable built-in objects.
Symbol.iterator property's value is a function that returns an iterator of the iterable object.
Let's understand it better by getting hold of an array iterator.

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let arrItr = arr[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(arrItr);
```

We get the following iterator function as output.

<details>
    <summary>
        <i>Array Iterator</i>
    </summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Prototype]]: Array Iterator <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next: Æ’ next(){' '}
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbol(Symbol.toStringTag):
    "Array Iterator" <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Prototype]]:
    Object <br />
</details>

When we iterate an iterable object using `for...of` loop, the `for...of` loop simply delegates
the iteration process to the iterator function. The iterator function calls next() and gets all
the values until all values are exhausted.

`for...of` loop can't get any simpler. Here are examples showing looping over arrays, strings,
maps and sets.

```js
let cities = ['New Delhi', 'Washington DC', 'London', 'Paris'];
for (let city of cities) {
    console.log(city);
}
// logs New Delhi, Washington DC, London, Paris

let name = 'Prerak';
for (let char of name) {
    console.log(char);
}
// logs P r e r a k

let citiesSet = new Set();
citiesSet.add('New Delhi');
citiesSet.add('Washington DC');
citiesSet.add('London');
citiesSet.add('Paris');
for (let city of citiesSet) {
    console.log(city);
}
//logs New Delhi, Washington DC, London, Paris

let capital_cities = new Map();
capital_cities.set('India', 'New Delhi');
capital_cities.set('USA', 'Washington DC');
capital_cities.set('UK', 'London');
capital_cities.set('France', 'Paris');
for (let capital_city of capital_cities) {
    console.log(capital_city);
}
// logs ['India', 'New Delhi'], ['USA', 'Washington DC'], ['UK', 'London'], ['France', 'Paris']
```

<HighlightedNote content="Since an object does not have @@iterator implemented, it is not iterable." />
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38777177" target="_blank">
    This
</a> pretty rationally argues why an object does not need for it to be iterable.

It is worth a mention that we can convert any iterable object to an array. Continuing with the
above example:

```js
// Convert a string to an array of characters
let charArray = [...name]
// charArray -> [ 'P', 'r', 'e', 'r', 'a', 'k' ]

//Convert citiesSet to an array of cities
let citiesArray = [...citiesSet]
// citiesArray -> ['New Delhi', Washington DC', 'London', 'Paris']

Convert capital_cities map to an array of cities
let capital_cities = [...capital_cities]
// [['India', 'New Delhi'], ['USA', 'Washington DC'], ['UK', 'London'], ['France', 'Paris']]
```
